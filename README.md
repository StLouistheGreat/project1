# DATA OVERVIEW
As a traffic stop analyst for the US Traffic Stop Agency, I would be conducting an in-depth analysis of car crash data. Here is an Overview of the data set:

Number of records: 84,278 rows and 44 columns
Key columns: Road Condition, Collision Type, Weather, Light, Road Grade, Agency Name, Crash Date/Time
Date range: 2015-2022


# OBJECTIVES
The objective was data exploration to make sense of the data set using sound statistical and visualization methods.


After the necessary cleaning and data wrangling, we were left with a data set of rows and columns being (64295, 47) respectively. We set out to answer the following question:

What are top 5 “Road Conditions” with most accidents? 
What are the top 5 most frequent “'Collision Type”? 
What are the top 5 most frequent “Weather” conditions?
What are the top 5 most frequent “'Light” conditions? 
What are the most frequent “Road Condition” and “Road grade”?
How the number of crashed changes over day time? 
Which day of the week has more crashes? 
Get the evolution of the number of crashes per hour.
Get the evolution of crashes per year. 
Which agency has reported more crashes?
We could expect that the mean number of crashes over the weekends is bigger than during labour days. Make a two sample t-test to evaluate this hypothesis 

# CONCLUSION
In summary, a 64295 by 47 cleaned data set of crash data in the USA between 2015 and 2022 was analysed  and here are some key findings:

Frequency Analysis: Crashes happen in more normal road, lighting and weather conditions than otherwise. Also, most if that data came from Montgomery County Police Station.
Time Series Analysis: Accidents happen largely during peak activity times in the morning and late afternoons.
Statistical Analysis: More accidents occur during the weekdays than the weekend.
